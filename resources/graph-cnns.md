#### Papers

* :mortar_board: [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf) by Kipf & Welling (2017). About 8 pages of main content, but only about **3 pages** on the approach/model itself.
* There is also the :mortar_board: [PhD thesis](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=1b63b965-24c4-4bcd-aabb-b849056fa76d) by Thomas Kipf with more details
* A :mortar_board: [broad review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf) of Graph Neural Networks in general, showcasing how GCNs embed in the field.

#### Articles
* :baby: [Explanation](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-deep-learning-on-graphs-with-graph-convolutional-networks-7d2250723780) of GCNs with code. 

#### Videos
* A very :baby: [basic introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KRAOZIULzw) to what GCNs are in 9 minutes. Helpful as a **starting point** 
* An **extensive** (2 hour long) :mortar_board: [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iiv9R6BjxHM) by Xavier Bresson (expert in graph deep learning)
